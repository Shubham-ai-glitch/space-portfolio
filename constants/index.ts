export const ABOUT_TEXT = `
I am Shubham Singh, a dedicated 11th-grade student and NEET aspirant currently studying at Aakash Institute, Mall Road, Kanpur. My journey is a unique blend of medical aspirations and a deep-rooted passion for advanced technology. While I am focused on my goal of clearing NEET and pursuing a career in Medical Sciences, I spend my time mastering the art of Frontend Development and exploring the intricate world of Cybersecurity.

Living and studying in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, I have developed a disciplined approach to learning, balancing the rigorous demands of biology with the technical challenges of coding. I specialize in building responsive, high-performance web applications using React.js and TypeScript. My expertise isn't limited to just UI/UX; I am a certified Cybersecurity Educator (CCEP) and have completed advanced training in Ethical Hacking, Digital Defense, and Advance Java.

My ultimate mission is to bridge the gap between Healthcare and Technology. I believe that the future of medicine lies in innovative digital solutions, and I aim to leverage my skills in software development and network security to create tools that can transform the medical field. From system vulnerability assessments to user-centric frontend designs, I am constantly evolving as a professional to make a real-world impact.
